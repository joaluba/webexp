Presentation: how to make a website with sound?

This presentation introduces the basics for creating websites with sound. 
With this presentation I wanted to answer a question if it would be worth to create 
online auditory experiments from scratch, by creating own websites with sounds. 
For that, I explored the topic a bit and I also created three very simple 
demos to show minimal examples of how to: 

1)...create a website and control some elements with Javascript:

2)...create a website with audio content using <audio> HTLM5 element:

3)...create a website with audio content and modify it using the Web Audio API
